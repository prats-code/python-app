# Smart City Solutions App

## Overview
This is a Python-based text application that explores smart city solutions in the areas of sustainability, transportation, and technology. It allows users to interact with various proposals aimed at creating more efficient and sustainable cities. The app provides suggestions on solar energy, smart waste management, electric vehicle charging stations, AI-based traffic management, and more.

## Features
- **Sustainability Solutions**: Proposals for solar energy integration, smart waste management, vertical farming, and rainwater harvesting.
- **Transportation Solutions**: Proposals for electric vehicle charging stations, AI traffic management, and autonomous public transport.
- **Technology Solutions**: Proposals for smart sensors, citywide WiFi, and AI-based waste sorting systems.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for solutions by keyword (e.g., solar, traffic, WiFi).
- **Feedback System**: Users can provide feedback on the proposed solutions.
